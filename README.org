#+TITLE: GraphyDB

GraphyDB is a graph database for Python built on top of SQLite.

There are many cases where a graph structure is a better fit to a problem domain than a set of tables.
GraphyDB was designed to fill a niche where a flexible embedded graph database was needed
for a moderate sized problem (~10,000 edges and nodes). GraphyDB is not designed to handle terrabytes
of data, and has not been particularly optimised for speed.


See [[https://aalexei.github.io/graphydb/][GraphyDB Docs]] for detailed documentation.
